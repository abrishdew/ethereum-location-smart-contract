# Web3:Ethereum - Refund by Location Smart Contract
***

### Project Overview

GeoLogix Solutions utilises a location-based smart contract to facilitate automatic
payments for drivers who remain within specified geographic zones for set durations.
We will be creating a DApp for this project in which the primary goal is to set up a
location tracking mechanism between an employee and an employer.

### Project Guide

The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for
example, an employer, agrees to pay another party, in this case - employee - for being
present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employee’s phone
sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the
pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment
is executed when all the agreed conditions are met.

### Approaches and Techniques
To implement this a set of plans as well as tools have been used.
- React JS: for the web dApp
- Flutter: for the mobile dApp
- Solidity: for Contract’s programing language
- Web3.js: for interacting with the contracts from UI
- Truffle: to deploy, test, and compile our contracts
- Metamask: for linking accounts to perform transactions
- Ganache(Optional): for creating Ethereum blockchain on the local machine
Using the tools mentioned above the project can be implemented to see its final
output where we can have an Ethereum smart contract that is based on location.

### Usage
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/abrishdew/ethereum-location-smart-contract.git

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

*GET YOUR LOCATION STRAIGHT!*
